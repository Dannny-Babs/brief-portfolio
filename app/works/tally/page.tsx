                    Tally is a Flutter-based personal finance app designed to help you track income, expenses, savings, and more. Built with a clean, minimal aesthetic and BLoC state management, it offers a smooth, native-like experience across platforms.

                    Like most students and creatives, I tracked money in spreadsheetsâ€¦ until I got tired of using spreadsheets to track my finances, so I decided to build my own app. I wanted a tool that:
                    <ul className="list-disc list-inside my-4 pl-4">
                        <li>Gave me visibility into my savings and expenses</li>
                        <li>Was mobile and simple</li>
                        <li>Didn&apos;t need to send my data to a third-party service</li>
                    </ul>
                    So I decided to build it myself. Tally was born.

                    Despite solid progress, I hit a few roadblocks:
                    <ul className="list-disc list-inside my-4 pl-4">
                        <li>No access to a Mac limited iOS testing/building</li>
                        <li>Real-device testing was inconsistent due to hardware availability</li>
                        <li>Solo development meant slow progress on implementation + testing</li>
                    </ul>
                    Still, the architecture, design system, and early build are solid foundations for future work.

                    Tally was a fast-paced solo project that gave me room to build and think clearly. Because it was scoped small, I could move quickly, experiment with ideas, and focus on what mattered without getting stuck in overengineering.

                    <br />
                    <br />
                    I learned how to plan and prioritize features based on what was realistic for one person to ship. I mapped out data models in a way that supported future scalability, especially around personal finance tracking. I implemented local storage for real-world persistence and learned how to use SharedPreferences efficiently.

                    <br />
                    <br />
                    The project helped me design responsive UIs that felt natural across devices and encouraged me to constantly ask: if this works on Android, will it work just as well on iOS? While I couldn&apos;t fully test iOS due to hardware limitations, it pushed me to think more cross-platform.

                    <br />
                    <br />
                    I didn&apos;t rely on AI while building Tally. Most of the UI was designed directly in code from scratch. I barely touched Figma, using my instincts and experience to make layout and motion decisions on the fly.

                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Using the BLoC pattern helped me manage state in a clean and predictable way. I focused on error handling, smooth data flow, and making sure user input was handled consistently throughout the app.

                    <br />
                    <br />

                    The roadmap is in place, and I know how I&apos;d return to it when the timing and tools align. Whether I continue in Flutter or rebuild it in React Native or native Swift, Tally is the kind of project that sharpened how I design, plan, and ship products that matter.
